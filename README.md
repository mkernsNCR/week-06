# Week 06

### Question 1

You're working on your Tunr app and you encounter this error. What does it mean and where would you go first to address it?  

![Rails error](http://i.imgur.com/9NR7XNT.png)  

```text
I'm missing and index.html.erb template file.
```

### Question 2

Consider this file name:

```
20150726145027_create_artists.rb
```

What is the purpose of this file, and what is the purpose of the numbers at the beginning of its name?

```text
This is a migration file and the numbers at the beginning are the timestamp of when that migration was ran. The timestamps are there to keep a record of changes you make to your tables.
```

### Question 3

In a Rails application, how is the router related to controller actions?  

```text
The router brings the request from the clients browser directly to the controller and the controller decides what kind of response it needs to get and from where.
```

### Question 4

Assuming our Tunr Rails app (1) has a Song model that belongs to an Artist model and (2) uses nested resources, which of the following helpers would create a URL that routes to `songs#new`? (Select one answer)  

```
[] artist_song_path( @artist, @song )
[X] new_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] create_artist_song_path( @artist )
[] new_artist_song_path( @artist, Song.all )
[] new_song_path( @song )
```

### Question 5

Where are (a) cookies and (b) session variables stored? (Select one answer)  

```
[] (a) Server, (b) Browser  
[] (a) Browser, (b) Database  
[] (a) Database, (b) Server  
[X] (a) Browser, (b) Server  
```

### Question 6

Assume each Song in Tunr has an `avg_rating` attribute. It is an integer from 1 to 10, and is the average rating of all of Tunr's millions of enthusiastic users.

You would like the title of each song to be displayed in a different color depending on the song's rating.

A great song like "Livin' on a Prayer" would have a rating of 10 and appear green, and a bad song like "Blurred Lines" would have a rating of 1 and appear red.

Without getting into specifics of how you would write the code itself, pick one and defend your answer:

This code would make most sense as a...
- ...model method.
- ...controller method.
- ...helper method.

```text
I would choose a helper method because it's main function is to change or edit something on the view and the models retrieve and change data in the Database. Also the controller decides which routes to take.
```

### Question 7

You clone yet another Tunr repo. Put the following commands in the correct order necessary to make the app run. Delete the one command that will not be used.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-exercises/moar-tunr.git
$ bundle install
$ rake db:drop
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
```

### Question 8

You're a good person and decide to validate your HTML. You copy and paste the contents of `app/views/artists/index.html.erb` into the validator:

```erb
<h2>Artists</h2>

<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <div><%= link_to artist.name, artist %></div>
<% end %>
```

The validator throws errors at you! Why? Assuming you haven't made any mistakes in your code, how could you go about accurately validating your HTML?

```
The clown tags are not valid HTML features because the content inside hasn't been rendered and replaced yet. Once you visit the browser console and view sources there you can copy and paste the html from there into a validator and it will work.
```

### Question 9

What are two differences between the two following commands?

```
$ rails new tunr
$ rails new . -d postgresql
```

```
If you do $ rails new tunr the default Database is SQL, while $ rails new . -d postgresql is using postgres's Database.
```

### Question 10

Which **one** of the following is the most correct way to display an error message to the user?

```rb
[] @error = "Wrong password!"
[] puts "Wrong password!"
[X] flash[:alert] = "Wrong password!"
[] session[:error] = "Wrong password!"
[] render error: "Wrong password!"
[] flash[:notice] = "Wrong password!"
```
